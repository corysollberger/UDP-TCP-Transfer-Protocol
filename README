C Program | UDP+TCP Data Transfer | Created by: Cory Sollberger 5/5/16

This program is a UDP layer data transfer that is safely handled by TCP acknowledgement.
A Client program requests a file from the server from which it is sent the data in UDP packets.

The UDP packets are then identified, checked, and acknowledged upon receipt through TCP packets.

Data that is lost in transit is requested again through TCP, which then fires a message to the
UDP protocol to resend the desired packet.

Run the program by building through the makefile included or by using the pre-built object files.

Run the command "./udpServer.o" on the server computer

Run the command "./udpClient.o" on the client computer

The server needs to be running before the client can connect to it.

Included are several textfiles that hold example data to transfer.

The file built from the transfer is called "RESULTS.txt"

Run a md5checksum on the file transferred and the file received to verify.
